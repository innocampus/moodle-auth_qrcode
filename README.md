# 🚀 Login via QR #

### 😩 Ever tried typing your password on...

* 📺 a giant smartboard?
* 🎓 a classroom PC with a sticky keyboard?
* 🖥️ a public computer lab?
* 📡 a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV? (For whatever reason you wanna login to Moodle...)
* 😵 a keyboard where **Caps Lock** has a personality of its own?

If your answer is **"Unfortunately, yes."**, this plugin is for you.

Simply open the login page, scan the QR code with a device that's already signed in (usually your phone 📱), approve the login, and you're in.

No typing.
No forgotten passwords.
No "Is it my username or my email?"

Just **Scan → Confirm → Login.** 🎉

### 🔐 How it works

When the login page is opened, Moodle creates a temporary QR login request containing a random token and the a secret. The QR code only contains the token.

After scanning the QR code with a device that's already signed in, the user confirms the login. Moodle then verifies that the request belongs to the same browser that generated the QR code before completing the login. Once used (or expired), the QR login request is removed and cannot be used again.
